# Intro to Ruby 
This is a crash course on Ruby taken almost completely from Cecy Correa's awesome [Ruby on Rails workshop](https://github.com/cecyc/ruby-rails-gdi-atx) for GDI ATX! 

The purpose of this workshop is to get students familiar with Ruby basics by writing small programs. The format today is slides, demos, then hands-on time.

Topics covered:

* strings
* integers
* puts / prints
* looping
* arrays
* hashes
* classes
* inheritance

Tools used: repl.it online Ruby repl.
